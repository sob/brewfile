## Introduction

This repository contains my Brewfile, which manages much of the software that I use on my workstation.

This Brewfile helps me install:

* Desktop applications, such as browsers, players, editors, etc.
* System utilities, such as command line interfaces, sysop helpers, etc.
* Programming capabilties, such as languages, toolchains, servers, etc.

To learn about Brewfile capabilties, please see:

## Usage

To use this Brewfile via `brew bundle`:

```sh
$ brew bundle
```
